error[E0277]: the trait bound `HashMap<String, AttributeValue>: From<String>` is not satisfied
 --> tests/ui/fails/enum_newtype_tagged.rs:3:10
  |
3 | #[derive(Dynamodel)]
  |          ^^^^^^^^^ the trait `From<String>` is not implemented for `HashMap<String, AttributeValue>`, which is required by `String: Into<_>`
  |
  = help: the trait `From<NewType>` is implemented for `HashMap<String, AttributeValue>`
  = help: for that trait implementation, expected `NewType`, found `String`
  = note: required for `String` to implement `Into<HashMap<String, AttributeValue>>`
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Dynamodel` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
